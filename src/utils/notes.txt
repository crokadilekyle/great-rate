users = {
    id: {
        id,
        name,
        avatar,
        categories: -> [id] (array: categories created)
        submissions: {  (object: categories joined)
            categoryid: submissionid, (categoryid is key, submissionid is key)
        },
        votes: { (categories voted on)
            categoryid: vote (up or down)
        }
    }
}
categories = {
    id: {
        id,
        name
    }
}

submissions = {
    id: {
        id,
        category: -> [id],
        image,
        votes:
            total,
            upvotes,
            downvotes
    }
}
